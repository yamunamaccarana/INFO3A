INFO3A
======

Projects to completion of Informatica3A course with Angelo Gargantini.
As they are typically academic matters, they investigate arguments treated during the course.

**Structure**

• [ASM](https://github.com/yamunamaccarana/INFO3A/tree/master/ASM_ABS) contains the implementation of a ABS (Antilock Braking System) with the possibility for the user to simulate its states' sequence;

• [C++](https://github.com/yamunamaccarana/INFO3A/tree/master/C%2B%2B_SimulationGame/src) contains the implementation of a simulation game in which the user has to regulate their car's speed in order to reach a destination avoiding possible accidents. It contains example of inheritance, concrete random values, enum, structures, pointers etc.;

• [SCALA](https://github.com/yamunamaccarana/INFO3A/tree/master/SCALA_ControlSystem/src) contains an example of the structure of a control system. In particular, it contains the implementation of a PID controller and it can simulate the behaviour of a real system through its model.
